# Message Coder/Decoder

Created as part of University assignemt: "Custom OOP app" using Kivy for UI and custom totally not secure encoding based on custom charset and numbering system.
Somewhat similar to base64 but it's 90 characters charset and adds some of randomness, also to simplify my work its limited only to characters up to value 8099 in utf-8 charset which resoults in 2 chars in my encoding per utf-8 everything above won't work
